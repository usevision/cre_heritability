# VISION cCRE Trait Heritability Enrichment

This directory contains code and data to replicate the trait heritability analyses done for [Cross-species regulatory landscapes and elements revealed by novel joint systematic integration of human and mouse blood cell epigenomes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.02.535219v1).

Specifically, we used (linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC))[https://github.com/bulik/ldsc] to quantify whether VISION human blood cell candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) were enriched for heritability of 587 traits from (UKBB)[https://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank].
